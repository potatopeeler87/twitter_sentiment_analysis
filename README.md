# twitter_sentiment_analysis
Hello! This is the code that I used for the research (just the final working parts). 
If you run it without any modifications, in the order the files are named, it will scrape all the tweets mentioning Lululemon between 15/09/2019 and 20/09/2019. 
Then it will translate the tweets that are not in English.
Then it will do the sentiment analysis using vader and the topic modelling using pyLDAvis.
